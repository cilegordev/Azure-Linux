Quick Start
===

## Prerequisites
Install prerequisites [here](prerequisites.md).

## Build Tools
By default all build commands are executed from inside the `./toolkit` folder.  A set of GO Based Tools and a Toolchain must be built before building Mariner Packages and Images.

```bash
cd ~/git/CBL-Mariner/toolkit
sudo make toolchain REBUILD_TOOLS=y REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=y
```

NOTE: A full list of targets and options to sudo make is available [here](#all-build-targets) and [here](#all-build-variables).

## Build Packages
Once the toolchain is built, all packages can be built with the toolchain.  Large parts of the build are parallelized. Enable this by setting the `-j` flag for `make` to the number of parallel jobs to allow. (Recommend setting this value to the number of hyper-threads available on your system, or less)

```bash
# Still from the toolkit folder, copy the toolchain archive built in the previous step into the toolkit folder
mv ../build/toolchain/toolchain_built_rpms_all.tar.gz .

# Build ALL packages FOR AMD64
sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE= TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=toolchain_built_rpms_all.tar.gz DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=y REBUILD_TOOLS=y REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=n REBUILD_PACKAGES=y PACKAGE_IGNORE_LIST="openjdk8 openjdk8_aarch64 shim-unsigned-aarch64"

# Build ALL packages FOR ARM64
sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE= TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=toolchain_built_rpms_all.tar.gz DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=y REBUILD_TOOLS=y REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=n REBUILD_PACKAGES=y PACKAGE_IGNORE_LIST="openjdk8 openjdk8_amd64 shim-unsigned-amd64"
```

## Build Images
Different images can be produced from the build system.  All images are generated in the out/images folder.

```bash
# Still from the toolkit folder

# To build a Mariner VHD Image (VHD folder: ../out/images/core-legacy)
sudo make image CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/core-legacy.json TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=toolchain_built_rpms_all.tar.gz REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=n REBUILD_PACKAGES=n REBUILD_TOOLS=y REPO_LIST=

# To build a Mariner VHDX Image (VHDX folder ../out/images/core-efi)

sudo make image CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/core-legacy.json TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=toolchain_built_rpms_all.tar.gz REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=n REBUILD_PACKAGES=n REBUILD_TOOLS=y REPO_LIST=

# To build a Mariner ISO Image (ISO folder: ../out/images/full)
sudo make iso CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/full.json TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=toolchain_built_rpms_all.tar.gz REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=n REBUILD_PACKAGES=n REBUILD_TOOLS=y REPO_LIST=

# To build a Mariner Contianer Image (Container Folder: ../out/images/core-container/*.tar.gz
sudo make image CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/core-container.json TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=./toolchain_built_rpms_all.tar.gz REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=n REBUILD_PACKAGES=n REBUILD_TOOLS=y REPO_LIST=
```

# Further Reading
## ISOs
ISO installers can be built with:
```bash
# Build out/images/developer_iso/*.iso from remote components
sudo make iso -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE=./resources/imageconfigs/developer_iso/developer_iso.json
```
To create an unattended ISO installer (no interactable UI):
````bash
# Build out/images/developer_iso/*.iso from remote components with unattended installer
sudo make iso -j$(nproc) CONFIG_FILE=./resources/imageconfigs/developer_iso/developer_iso.json UNATTENDED_INSTALLER=y
````
NOTE: ISOs require additional packaging and build steps (such as the creation of a separate `initrd` installer image used to install the final image to disk).

## Packages
The toolkit can download packages from remote RPM repositories, or build them locally. By default any `*.spec` files found in `SPECS_DIR="./SPECS"` will be built locally. Dependencies will be downloaded as needed. Only those packages needed to build the current config will be built (`core-efi.json` by default). An additional space separated list of packages may be added using the `PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST=` variable.

Build all local packages needed for the default `core-efi.json`:
```bash
sudo make build-packages -j$(nproc)
```

Build only two packages along with their prerequisites (note `CONFIG_FILE` is explicitly cleared, not specifying it will use the default `core-efi.json` config):
```bash
sudo make build-packages PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST="vim nano" CONFIG_FILE= -j$(nproc)
```

Build packages from a custom SPECS dir:
```bash
sudo make build-packages SPECS_DIR="/my/packages/SPECS" -j$(nproc)
```

### Working on Packages
The build system will attempt to minimize rebuilds, but sometimes it is useful to force packages to rebuild, or ignore missing packages. Say you want to iterate on the `nano` package, but the `ncurses-devel` package is broken (`ncurses-devel` is a dependency of `nano`)...

#### Force Rebuilds
Adding `PACKAGE_REBUILD_LIST="nano"` will tell the build system to always rebuild `nano.spec` even if it thinks the rpm file is up to date.

#### Ignoring Packages
In the event the ncurses package is currently having issues, `PACKAGE_IGNORE_LIST="ncurses"` will tell the build system to pretend the `ncurses.spec` file was already successfully built regardless of the actual local state. As before, explicitly clear the `CONFIG_FILE` variable to skip adding `core-efi.json`'s packages.
```bash
# Work on the nano package while ignoring the state of the ncurses package
sudo make build-packages PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST="nano" PACKAGE_REBUILD_LIST="nano" PACKAGE_IGNORE_LIST="ncurses" CONFIG_FILE=
```
Any build which requires the ignored packages will still attempt to use them during a build, so ensure they are available in the `../out/RPMS` folder.

#### Source Hashes
The build system also enforces hash checking for sources when packaging SRPMs. For a given `*.spec` file a hash of each source is recorded in `*.signatures.json`. The build system will attempt to find a source which matches the recorded hash. If you change a source the signature file can be updated by setting `SRPM_FILE_SIGNATURE_HANDLING=update`.
```bash
# Just update the intermediate SRPMs and their source signatures by using the input-srpms target
sudo make input-srpms SRPM_FILE_SIGNATURE_HANDLING=update
```

Keys, Certs, and Remote Sources
===
## Sources
The build system pulls files two ways:
- Downloading files directly.
- Using the `tdnf` package management tool running inside a chroot.

Direct file downloads are by default pulled from:
```makefile
SOURCE_URL         ?=
PACKAGE_URL        ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)/prod/base/$(build_arch)/rpms
PACKAGE_UPDATE_URL ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)/prod/update/$(build_arch)/rpms
SRPM_URL           ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)/prod/base/srpms
```
While `tdnf` uses a list of repo files:
```makefile
REPO_LIST ?=
```
The `REPO_LIST` variable supports multiple repo files, and they are prioritized in the order they appear in the list.
The CBL-Mariner base repo is implicitly provided, and an optional update repo is available by setting `USE_UPDATE_REPO=y`. If `$(DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS)` is set to `y`, any repo that is accessed through the network is disabled.

## Authentication
If supplying custom endpoints for source/SRPM/package servers, accessing these resources may require keys and certificates. The keys and certificates can be set using:
```bash
sudo make image CA_CERT=/path/to/rootca.crt TLS_CERT=/path/to/user.crt TLS_KEY=/path/to/user.key
```

Building Everything From Scratch
===
The build system can operate without using pre-built components if desired. There are several variables which enable/disable build components and sources of data. They are listed here along with their default values:
```makefile
SOURCE_URL         ?= 
PACKAGE_URL        ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/cbl-mariner-$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)-prod-base-$(build_arch)-rpms
PACKAGE_UPDATE_URL ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/cbl-mariner-$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)-prod-update-$(build_arch)-rpms
SRPM_URL           ?= https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/cbl-mariner-$(RELEASE_MAJOR_ID)-prod-base-srpms
REPO_LIST          ?=
```
```makefile
DOWNLOAD_SRPMS         ?= n
REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN      ?= n
REBUILD_PACKAGES       ?= y
REBUILD_TOOLS          ?= n
USE_UPDATE_REPO        ?= y
DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS ?= n
TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE      ?=
PACKAGE_ARCHIVE        ?=
```
See [Local Build Variables](#local-build-variables) for details on what each variable does.

## Bootstrapping the Toolchain and Building Everything from Scratch
This command will build all components locally, including all toolchain packages using a two stage bootstrap process. No sources will be pulled remotely **(Unless a package build explicitly attempts to do so within its `*.spec` file)**.

Just the toolchain build will take several hours, building `core-efi.json` may take the better part of a day.
```bash
# Bootstrap just the toolchain
sudo make toolchain SOURCE_URL="" PACKAGE_URL="" PACKAGE_UPDATE_URL="" REPO_LIST="" REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y

# Rebuild just the tools
sudo make go-tools REBUILD_TOOLS=y
```
```bash
# Complete rebuild of all tool, package, and image files from source.
sudo make image SOURCE_URL="" PACKAGE_URL="" PACKAGE_UPDATE_URL="" REPO_LIST="" REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y REBUILD_PACKAGES=y REBUILD_TOOLS=y
```

## Local Build Variables

### URLS and Repos
The build can be configured to prioritize local builds but still use the remote sources if needed. For example: If a locally defined `*.spec` file has build dependencies which are not satisfied locally.

If that is not desired all remote sources can be disabled by clearing the following variable:
### `SOURCE_URL=...`
> URL to download unavailable source files from when creating `*.src.rpm` files prior to build.
### `PACKAGE_URL=...`
> URL to download RPM packages from, used to populate the toolchain packages if they are missing.
### `PACKAGE_UPDATE_URL=...`
> URL to download RPM packages from if not found under `$(PACKAGE_URL)` and `$(USE_UPDATE_REPO)` is set to `y`, used to populate the toolchain packages if they are missing.
### `SRPM_URL=...`
> URL to download packed SRPM packages from prior to build if `$(DOWNLOAD_SRPMS)` is set to `y`.
### `REPO_LIST=...`
> List of RPM repositories to pull packages from. These packages are used to satisfy dependencies during the build process, and to compose a final image. Locally available packages are always prioritized. The repos are prioritized based on the order they appear in the list: Repos earlier in the list are higher priority.

### Build Enable/Disable Flags

### `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=...`
#### `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=`**`n`**:*(default)*
> Use pre-existing toolchain packages from another source. If `TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE=my_toolchain.tar.gz` is also set the build system will extract the required packages from that archive. If `TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE` is not set the build system will download the required toolchain packages from `$(PACKAGE_URL)` and `$(PACKAGE_UPDATE_URL)`.
#### `REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=`**`y`**:
> Bootstrap the toolchain from the host environment in a docker container. The toolchain consists of those packages which are required to build all other packages (*gcc, tdnf, etc*)

### `DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=...`
#### `DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=`**`n`**:*(default)*
> Pack SRPMs to be built from local SPECs. Will retrieve sources from the SPEC's folder if available, and will download missing sources from `$(SOURCE_URL)`.
#### `DOWNLOAD_SRPMS=`**`y`**:
> Download official pre-packed SRPMs from `$(SRPM_URL)`. Use this option if `$(SOURCE_URL)` is not available.

### `USE_UPDATE_REPO=...`
#### `USE_UPDATE_REPO=`**`y`**:*(default)*
> Pull missing packages from the upstream update repository in addition to the base repository.
#### `USE_UPDATE_REPO=`**`n`**:
> Only pull missing packages from the upstream base repository.

### `DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=...`
#### `DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=`**`n`**:*(default)*
> Pull packages from all set repositories, including external ones accessed through the network.
#### `DISABLE_UPSTREAM_REPOS=`**`y`**:
> Only pull missing packages from local repositories. This does not affect hydrating the toolchain from `$(PACKAGE_URL)` and `$(PACKAGE_UPDATE_URL)`.

### `REBUILD_PACKAGES=...`
#### `REBUILD_PACKAGES=`**`y`**:*(default)*
> Parse all local `*.spec` files, and build them if needed.
> A package will be built
> - If:
>   - it is present in `CONFIG_FILE=config.json`
>   - or it is listed in `PACKAGE_BUILD_LIST="..."`
>   - or it is a dependency of a package listed in one of the above
> - And:
>   - the corresponding *.rpm files are missing
>   - or the *.rpm files are out of date (based on version numbers)
>   - or the base package is listed in `PACKAGE_REBUILD_LIST`

#### NOTE:
The `*.spec` files are converted to `*.src.rpm` files which bundle the spec files with their source files. If the build tools are not able to find valid source files **which match the SHA1 hash recorded in `*.signatures.json`** then they will attempt to locate the source files from `$(SOURCE_URL)` and download them.

#### `REBUILD_PACKAGES=`**`n`**:
> Do not attempt to build any local specs, always download the packages via `tdnf` from the internet if they are missing.
#### NOTE:
It is possible to hydrate the local `*.rpm` files with a one-time manual operation:
```bash
# Create ./out/rpms.tar.gz from the *.rpm files locally available:
sudo make compress-rpms
```
```bash
# Extract all rpms present in rpms.tar.gz into a build environment:
sudo make hydrate-rpms PACKAGE_ARCHIVE=./rpms.tar.gz
```

### `REBUILD_TOOLS=...`
#### `REBUILD_TOOLS=`**`n`**:*(default)*
> Use pre-compiled go binaries, likely provided as part of an SDK. The binaries are expected to be found in `$(TOOL_BINS_DIR)`
#### `REBUILD_TOOLS=`**`y`**:
> Build the go tools from source as needed.

Reproducing a Build
===
By default the build system will pull the highest possible version of external packages when building. However, there may be circumstances when you wish to reproduce a build using the exact same external package versions as before, even if newer versions are available.

#### Build Summaries
The build system supports this behavior through summary files, a JSON representation of packages consumed during a build. By referencing these summary files, the build system can consume the exact same version of external packages later on.

Since the summary files are regenerated every build, if you wish to reproduce a build, you should save the summary files to another location for future use.

| Type of Build                 | Summary File Location                                                                                  | Description
|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---
| Package Build                 | `$(PKGBUILD_DIR)/graph_external_deps.json`                                                             | Generated every package build. Can be saved and used later with the `$(PACKAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY)` variable to reproduce a package build.
| Image Build                   | `$(IMAGEGEN_DIR)/{imagename}/image_deps.json`                                                          | Generated every image build. Can be saved and used later with the `$(IMAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY)` variable to reproduce an image build.
| Initrd Build                  | `$(IMAGEGEN_DIR)/iso_initrd/image_deps.json`                                                           | Generated every initrd and ISO build. Can be saved and used later with the `$(INITRD_CACHE_SUMMARY)` variable to reproduce an initrd build.

#### Building From Summaries
To reproduce a build, there are four constraints
1. The local SPEC files must be the same. That is, you cannot reproduce a build having modified any of the local SPEC files since when the summary files were generated.
2. What is being built must be the same. That is, if the summary files were generated from an image build then the reproduced build must be building the exact same image configuration.
3. The toolkit version must be the same. That is, if the summary files were generated from a `1.0` toolkit, then the reproduced build must be done using the `1.0` toolkit.
4. The builds must be from clean. Both the build that generated the summary files and the reproduced build must be done from a clean state, otherwise there may be leftover files that affect the summary files.

If the above constraints are met then a build can be reproduced from summary files.

###### Reproducing a Package Build
To reproduce a package build, run the same make invocation as before, but set:
- `PACKAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY=<path>` to the path of the package build summary file.

###### Reproducing an Image Build
To reproduce an image build, run the same make invocation as before, but set:
- `PACKAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY=<path>` to the path of the package build summary file.
- `IMAGE_CACHE_SUMMMARY=<path>` to the path of the image build summary file.

###### Reproducing an ISO Build
To reproduce an ISO build, run the same make invocation as before, but set:
- `PACKAGE_CACHE_SUMMARY=<path>` to the path of the package build summary file.
- `IMAGE_CACHE_SUMMMARY=<path>` to the path of the image build summary file.
- `INITRD_CACHE_SUMMMARY=<path>` to the path of the initrd build summary file.
